                        <p>The general case of recognizing an object is way easier for a human but the same pose a 
                            significant challenge for a computer system and are hard for a computer software. The effort as a 
                            part of this project is to implement the feature for recognizing/classifying an object by an 
                            application with acceptable accuracy.</p>

                        <p>The goal is to build an application or framework that can be trained and used to recognize 
                            images. Implementation is with TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) as a framework for
                            deep learning to build and train models which would then be used to recognize/classify images, 
                            programs written in in Java/Python for the logical/business layer which are exposed as RESTful 
                            endpoints with Oracle JET acting as client for the web/presentation layer and JPA for interacting 
                            with the database in the persistence layer. </p>

                        <p>At the end of mid-sem the application developed is able to integrate with a pre-trained 
                            model available with TensorFlow to recognize images and display results of recognition.</p>
